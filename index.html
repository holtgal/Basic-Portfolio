        Hello my name is Holt Galbraith, I am 25 years old and currently residing in Denver, Colorado.Disciplined and
        goal-driven Full Stack Web Developer and Graphic Designer actively seeking an opportunity to find a career in
        web development. Recently completed an intensive full-time web development program. I am dedicated to perfecting
        my craft by learning from more seasoned developers, remaining humble, and continuously making strides to learn
        all that I can about development. I believe that my understanding of problem solving and complex algorithms are
        also skills that have and will continue to contribute to my overall skills as a developer.
